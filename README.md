**Leveraging OWASP Top 10 for Robust Web Security**

## Introduction  
This course is designed to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of web application security, focusing on the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. It emphasizes both theoretical knowledge and practical skills to identify, mitigate, and prevent security threats in web applications.

### Prerequisites  
- Academic degree in Computer Science or Multimedia Design.
- Knowledge of web architecture, communication protocols, and technologies like SQL, NoSQL databases, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and C#.

### Learning Objectives  
- Understand the importance of web application security and its impact on system integrity.
- Identify and comprehend the OWASP Top 10 web application vulnerabilities.
- Implement security controls and best practices to mitigate common vulnerabilities.
- Gain hands-on experience in secure coding techniques and principles.
- Integrate security measures throughout the software development lifecycle.
- Develop a proactive approach to identifying and addressing potential security risks.

## Content  

### Session 1: Introduction to Web Application Security, OWASP Top 10 Overview, and Injection Flaws
- **Lecture**: Fundamentals of web security; overview of OWASP Top 10 with a focus on injection flaws like SQL and Command Injection.
- **Exercise**: Analyzing case studies of web application breaches; building and securing a basic login system to prevent SQL injection.

### Session 2: Authentication, Sensitive Data, and XXE
- **Lecture**: Broken Authentication mechanisms; Encryption and data protection methods; Overview of XML External Entities (XXE) attack mechanisms.

## Final Assignment  
As a culmination of the "Secure Web Applications" course, students are required to submit an extended abstract of a project where they perform a detailed security analysis and enhancement of a security related topic. This assignment is designed to synthesize the course content, emphasizing the practical application of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and the corresponding security measures.

### Objectives:
The extended abstract should demonstrate the student's ability to:
1. **Analyze** 
2. **Apply Theoretical Knowledge** 
3. **Implement Security Measures** 
4. **Reflect and Critique** 

### Requirements:
2. **Security Analysis Report** 
5. **Abstract Format** - The extended abstract should be between 1500-2000 words, well-organized, and adhere to the academic standards for abstracts. It should include an introduction, methodology, results, discussion, conclusion, and references.

### Submission Details:
- **Due Date**: [TBA]
- **Submission Format**: PDF
- **Submission Portal**: [TBA]

### Evaluation Criteria:
Submissions will be evaluated based on the depth of the security analysis, the effectiveness and creativity of the security measures implemented, the quality of the reflection and critique, and adherence to the abstract format and academic standards.
